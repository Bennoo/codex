# Bennoo Codex Guide

Welcome to the **Bennoo documentation hub** for the OpenAI Codex repository.  
These documents are designed for new contributors who want to understand the codebase, learn Rust, and begin contributing effectively.

## Document Map

- [Rust Fundamentals](./rust_fundamentals.md) – a crash course on the Rust language with emphasis on patterns used in this repo.
- [Repository Overview](./repo_overview.md) – explains the layout of the repo and the purpose of each crate or package.
- [Development Workflow](./development_workflow.md) – how to build, test, format, and submit changes.
- [Troubleshooting & Issue Handling](./troubleshooting.md) – tips for diagnosing problems and responding to user bug reports.

Each guide assumes minimal prior knowledge. After reading through them you should be able to:

1. Navigate the repository structure.
2. Understand how Rust ownership, modules, and Cargo work in practice.
3. Run the CLI and its tests.
4. Tackle issues and contribute high‑quality pull requests.

Happy hacking!
